1. What are the most used ES6 features?
The most used ES6 features are:
  - Let and Const: These are block-scoped variables replace var for better scoping and immutability.

  - Arrow functions: Concise syntax for functions with implicit 'this' binding.
      const fun = (a, b) => a+b;
  - Template literals : Easier string interpolation. Dynamic strings.
      const message = `Hello, ${name}!`;
  - Destructuring: Extract values from Arrays and objects
      const {firstName, lastName} = person;
  - Default parameters: Assign default values to function parameters.
        function greet(name = "Guest") {
              console.log(`Hello, ${name}`);
        }
  - Spread and Rest operators: Spread for expanding and rest for collecting.
            const arr = [1, 2, ...moreValues];
            const [first, ...rest] = arr;

  - Modules: Use import and export for modular code.
  - Promises: Simplify Asynchronous programming.
  - Classes: Introduced object-oriented syntax.
