In JavaScript, inheritance is achieved through prototype chain. Every object in JavaScript has internal property 
called [[Prototype]], which points to another object.

Prototypes allow one object to inherit properties and methods from another.

How it works?
    - When you access a property or a method on an object, JS first looks for it on the object itself.
    - If it's not found, JS looks up the prototype chain until it finds the property or reaches null.
